As with my other projects, this site is\nfree/_libre_, free/_gratis_ and open-source software, with the\n\u003CLink url=\"https://github.com/dhruvkb/portfolio\">source code\u003C/Link> available on\nGitHub to use as you like. Except steal and claim as your own, because that\nwould not be a nice thing to do.\n\nApart from this colophon, you might also find interesting [writing](/writings)\nrelated to this site under the \"portfolio\" tag.\n\n## Ideology\n\nThis site subscribes to many [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org) tenets such as\ndata and domain ownership, open-source tools and longevity of plain text files.\nI plan on integrating more IndieWeb technologies such as\n[RelMeAuth](https://indieweb.org/RelMeAuth) and\n[Webmention](https://indieweb.org/Webmention) in the future.\n\n## Design\n\n### Colors\n\nThe site's color palette comes from [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/),\nspecifically the Mocha and Latte variants for the dark and light modes\nrespectively. Earlier iterations of the site have used\n[Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) and\n[Flexoki](https://stephango.com/flexoki), both of which are also excellent color\npalettes.\n\n### Typography\n\nThe site uses [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) by Rasmus Andersson, as the\nsans-serif typeface. Inter is famously readable at all sizes and weights, for\nboth headings and body text. The résume, for a more classical look, uses the\nserif typeface [Spectral](https://productiontype.com/font/spectral) by\nProduction Type. Both fonts are open-source and licensed under the SIL Open Font\nLicense 1.1.\n\nThe programming typeface is set to `monospace` for a multitude of reasons:\n- This respects the font choices of the user. Programmers are very particular\n  about their typefaces, and letting them read in their preferred font makes for\n  a good experience.\n- Not having to download a font makes the site faster and more efficient, and\n  avoids the flash of unstyled text.\n\nUnfortunately, users of Safari will probably not have a choice in fonts, so they\nwill have to exercise their choice in web browsers.\n\n## Technology\n\nFor a developer portfolio, I find it ironic that this is a collection of largely\nstatic pages.\n\n- The site is built on the concept of progressive enhancement and can be used\n  without both CSS and JavaScript, with little or no degradation in the overall\n  experience.\n- The source code is [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org),\n  [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com), because\n  JS should be strongly typed, HTML should be broken into components and CSS\n  should be tokenized.\n- Open Graph images (_e.g._ [this one](/og/colophon.png)) are generated with\n  [`@vercel/og`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vercel/og). Automation is great\n  for tasks like this that are otherwise impossible to do manually with\n  consistency.\n- [GoatCounter](https://goatcounter.com) provides privacy-friendly metrics\n  without adding too much bloat. Data is only retained for 31 days. You can opt\n  out by disabling JavaScript in your browser.\n- My [interactive résumé](/resume/) and some other parts of the site generated\n  from a JSON file using [Récivi](https://recivi.vercel.app), a personal\n  endeavour to create a new kind of résumé for computers.\n- The only external requests this site makes are to\n  [Rasmus' site](https://rsms.me) for Inter,\n  [Goat Counter](https://goatcounter.com) for analytics and\n  [Google Fonts](https://) for Spectral (only on the résumé PDF page).\n\n{/* TODO: Add link to Récivi JSON file. */}","src/pages/colophon.mdx","022bc7929358cefe","index",{"id":30,"data":32,"body":38,"filePath":39,"digest":40,"deferredRender":16},{"title":33,"description":34,"index":35,"banRobots":26,"ogImage":36},"Home","Hi!
