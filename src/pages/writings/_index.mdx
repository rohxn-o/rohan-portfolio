# Blog

This is where I share my projects, blogs, and random thoughts. 
Whether it’s working on a project, exploring new concepts, or just documenting 
what I learn along the way, you’ll find it all here. Writing helps me organise 
my thoughts, and maybe some of them will be useful to you too!

If anything here resonates with you, feel free to reach out or subscribe to the 
[<Icon source="lucide" name="rss"/> RSS feed](/rss.xml) for updates!
