Hi there, I'm Rohan, a computing student  {
	residence && `based in ${addressDisplay(residence)}`
} who <FunFact />.

I have a particular interest in maths, technology, music and all of the above. 
If I’m not doing anything productive, you’ll probably find me practising the violin or exploring anything that interests me. 
I enjoy bringing *some* of my ideas to life with technology.

On here you can check out [some of my ideas](/writings) or <del>[read my CV](/resume)</del> ✨

## Contact

If you have a new and interesting idea that I could collaborate on, or want to
ask a question that I might be able to answer, or simply want to talk, you
should drop by and say hi!
