# Curriculum vitae

Uh, I'm not really looking for a job or have much to show here... so it'll just look pretty and sit here for now!

All the code I write outside of work, and most of what I write at work, is
free/_libre_, free/_gratis_ and open-source software. {
	githubUrl && <Fragment>You can find all of it on my <Link url={githubUrl}>GitHub profile</Link>.</Fragment>

If you like what you see here and want to work with me, you can grab the
<Link url={import.meta.env.DEV ? '/resume/pdf' : '/resume.pdf'}>PDF version</Link>
of this résumé. Print responsibly.
